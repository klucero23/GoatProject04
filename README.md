# Welcome! ( ´ ∀ `)ノ～ ♡ 🐐
This **README** provides detailed instructions on creating and populating the database for our project/application. 

### Overview
This project hoped to accomplish two main things: researching correlations between a goat's birth weight and other types of weight, as well as determining any trends in goat deaths during certain seasons.
The database, written entirely in sql, runs queries to help form these tables and give the user the information they are looking for. Our GUI, handled through a mixture of HTML, CSS, and JS by usage of Bootstrap, is designed in a way to visually please the user's eyes while effectively providing easy access to certain parts of the site needed to be accessed.    

### To Build the Database:
Follow these steps carefully to ensure the database is set up correctly and populated with the necessary data.
  
First, download the ‘Goats’ folder, which contains all files to be used.
In your terminal, follow each command to create the goatsdb database:

### To Run GUI 
Ensure python pip and psycopg2 packages are installed. If not, type in your terminal the following two commands:

Afterwards, ensure you are in the flask7dbs folder before proceeding. To run the website, simply execute:

Right click on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and run on a browser  

## Website Runthrough
Once executing "flask run" and running on a browser, this homescreen should appear:
